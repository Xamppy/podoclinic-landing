- **Animation State Consistency**: Tests for geometric shapes, particles, and main foot shape
- **Reduced Motion State**: Tests for static version rendering
- **Color Scheme Consistency**: Tests for design system color usage
- **Responsive Behavior**: Tests for different container sizes
- **Performance Visual Indicators**: Tests for loading states and quality levels

### 4. Integration Tests for Canvas with Hero Layout
**File**: `frontend/src/__tests__/integration/hero-canvas-integration.test.tsx`
- **Layout Integration**: Tests for z-index layering and responsive grid
- **Interactive Elements**: Tests for CTA button functionality and navigation
- **Error Handling Integration**: Tests for ThreeDErrorBoundary integration
- **Performance Integration**: Tests for dynamic loading and fallback states
- **Accessibility Integration**: Tests for keyboard navigation and reduced motion
- **Content Overlay Integration**: Tests for text contrast and benefit card visibility

### 5. WebGL Utilities Unit Tests
**File**: `frontend/src/lib/__tests__/webgl.test.ts`
- **WebGL Support Detection**: Tests for WebGL2/WebGL1 fallback and capability detection
- **Performance Tier Detection**: Tests for high/medium/low tier classification
- **Reduced Motion Hook**: Tests for media query integration and cleanup
- **Error Handling**: Tests for graceful fallback when WebGL is unavailable

## Test Coverage Areas

### Requirements Addressed
- **1.1**: Performance optimization and frame rate testing
- **1.4**: Comprehensive component testing
- **4.1**: Canvas integration with Hero layout
- **4.2**: Visual consistency and layout preservation

### Key Testing Features
1. **Performance Monitoring**: Frame rate measurement, render time tracking, memory usage validation
2. **Visual Consistency**: Cross-scroll-position testing, color scheme validation, responsive behavior
3. **Error Resilience**: WebGL fallback testing, retry mechanism validation, graceful degradation
4. **Integration Stability**: Layout preservation, interactive element functionality, accessibility compliance
5. **Device Compatibility**: Reduced motion support, mobile optimization, capability detection

## Test Structure and Organization

### Mocking Strategy
- **WebGL Context**: Comprehensive mocking for capability detection
- **Performance APIs**: Mock performance.now, requestAnimationFrame
- **DOM APIs**: Mock matchMedia, scrollIntoView, location.reload
- **React Testing**: Mock Framer Motion, Next.js dynamic imports

### Test Categories
1. **Unit Tests**: Individual component behavior and functionality
2. **Performance Tests**: Timing, memory, and efficiency measurements
3. **Visual Tests**: Rendering consistency and appearance validation
4. **Integration Tests**: Component interaction and layout integration

## Implementation Quality

### Best Practices Applied
- **Comprehensive Mocking**: All external dependencies properly mocked
- **Error Boundary Testing**: Proper error handling and recovery testing
- **Accessibility Testing**: Reduced motion and keyboard navigation support
- **Performance Benchmarking**: Quantitative performance measurements
- **Cross-browser Considerations**: Multiple viewport and device testing

### Test Reliability Features
- **Cleanup Procedures**: Proper test isolation and cleanup
- **Mock Management**: Consistent mock setup and teardown
- **Async Handling**: Proper async/await patterns for timing-sensitive tests
- **Edge Case Coverage**: Extreme values and error conditions tested

## Status

âœ… **COMPLETED**: All required test categories have been implemented according to the task specifications:
- Unit tests for HeroCanvas and 3D sub-components
- Performance tests measuring frame rate and render time
- Visual regression tests for different scroll positions
- Integration tests ensuring Canvas works with existing Hero layout

The comprehensive test suite provides thorough coverage of the 3D components' functionality, performance characteristics, visual consistency, and integration stability as required by the specification.
