# Performance Optimizations and Error Handling

This document summarizes the performance optimizations and error handling implementations for task 13.

## Implemented Features

### 1. React Error Boundaries

- **ErrorBoundary**: Generic error boundary with customizable fallback UI
- **AnimationErrorBoundary**: Specialized for animation components
- **ThreeDErrorBoundary**: Specialized for 3D model components

### 2. Lazy Loading Implementation

- **LazySection**: Component that lazy loads content when it enters viewport
- **useLazyLoad**: Hook for implementing lazy loading behavior
- Intersection Observer API for efficient viewport detection

### 3. Image Optimization

- **OptimizedImage**: Wrapper around Next.js Image component
- Loading states and error fallbacks
- Automatic optimization and responsive sizing

### 4. 3D Model with Loading States

- **FootModel**: 3D foot model using React Three Fiber
- Loading fallbacks and error boundaries
- Performance optimized with proper cleanup

### 5. Performance Monitoring

- **PerformanceMonitor**: Utility class for measuring component performance
- Web Vitals monitoring (LCP, FID, CLS)
- **useLoadingState**: Hook for managing loading states

### 6. Main Page Optimizations

- Lazy loading for below-fold sections
- Error boundaries wrapping all major components
- Dynamic imports for better code splitting
- Performance monitoring integration

## Key Benefits

1. **Improved Initial Load Time**: Lazy loading reduces initial bundle size
2. **Better Error Handling**: Graceful degradation when components fail
3. **Enhanced User Experience**: Loading states and fallbacks
4. **Performance Monitoring**: Real-time performance metrics
5. **Accessibility**: Proper error announcements and fallbacks

## Testing

Comprehensive test suite covering:
- Error boundary functionality
- Lazy loading behavior
- Loading state management
- Performance optimization integration
- Cross-component error handling

## Requirements Satisfied

- ✅ 6.1: Modern visual elements with 3D model and fallbacks
- ✅ 8: Smooth performance with optimized loading and error handling
